  <h1>Why I chose this combination of fonts</h1>
  <p>A short webpage about my choice of fonts</p>

  <h2>Serif vs Sans-Serif</h2>
  <p>Arvo is Serif while Lato is Sans-Serif, which contrasts from each other. While they both look
  similar, the main difference is that serif uses a decorative stroke at the end of the letters,
  while sans-serif does not. Using these two different, but very similar families goes on the line
  of relying on family and seeking the similar. While both look very similar thanks to their shared
  family, there is enough contrast between Arvo and Lato to differentiate from title and paragraph.
  Example of which is shown here and below.
