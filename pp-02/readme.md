## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=14G0u0kl7md8uEcfzrppWh0vlbz
Your Rationale:I chose to have a purple monochromatic color palette because of what it represents: creativity, and grandeur. It's a color representing royalty, and combines the calm blue and the fierce red. Making a new gaming console platform has to represent something new, and appealing, and while I'd love to use blue, Playstation already uses it. Purple is different enough from the three most popular consoles (Nintendo, Xbox, and Playstation) to differentiate itself, while having an appealing look to it.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=52J0u0klRm6bBwrh4qRq-hnvTbS
Your Rationale:I chose to use this color palette for springtime tours at the botanical gardens because of how green is normally associated with nature. It also helped that in this particular color palette was blue as well. I like what blue represents: calmness and serenity. All three shades have all have shades of green in it to represent nature, and on top of that, all three are also made with muted colors to make any advertising easy to look at, while at the same time, standing out enough to grab someone's attention.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=3010Z0ksNtEhLB0mKu+u-nu-diu
Your Rationale: I chose a very simple red yellow blue triadic color palette because it makes it easy and simple for kids. It was also very hard to try to make the colors stand out without making it too hard to look at. I'm not thinking that the red blue yellow palette will be the main focus of the login, I'd have it used sparing so it doesn't look like a pain to look at all the time.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=a3R140kujkVm3sirCpmAQg-LVba
Your Rationale: I chose a complementary color scheme with blue as my choice of color, with yellow being the complement. When I think of cybersecurity, the colors I think of are green and black, because of terminal, and due to all of the hacker stereotypes in media. I personally think that those colors would make cybersecurity an alien and complicated subject. I personally like blue, maybe a little to much, because of it's calmness. I chose it because I want the cybersecurity course to be open to people, and a place where people are welcome to learn, even though the color scheme does look like Ikea. Probably why Ikea uses yellow and blue.
