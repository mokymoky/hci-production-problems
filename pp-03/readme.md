## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/data-entry/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: For data entry, I tried to present the user with choices, for example using adding the multiple choice text box for prefix and suffix, to make it easy for the user to find. I also made sure to make it feel like the user is advancing through the account creation by splitting up the creation process into three different pages.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/animation/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: For animation, I decided to progress through the login page, the best way to do that would be a swipe right animation after hitting the continue button. This animation is a basic thing to let the user know they are progressing through the account creation. It swipes left or right depending on where the user decides to take the account, and if the user wants, they can turn it off if it is too disorientating. The swipe animations are meant to be a smooth transition from one side of account creation to the next.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I used a basic flat navigation that goes from one thing to another in a basic style, like the music and app store on apple. I feel that account creation should be made easy, so I decided a simple thing such as this would fit best for what navigation should be.

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
